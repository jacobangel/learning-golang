# Learning GoLang

I just made this repo to track my progress learning stuff with go-lang.
It's been a while since I've touched server side programming,
so this seemed like a good opportunity to learn some thing new.
I'm primarily following some recommendations from a few coworkers,
and of course going a bit overboard given the scope of the problem I'm attempting to solve with Go.

## Resources

### Learn by Examples
- https://gobyexample.com/
- https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

### Books
- [Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)
- [Programming in Go](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Go-Creating-Applications-Developers/dp/0321774639)

## Plan

- [ ] Work my way through one of the resources cover-to-cover
- [ ] Write out by hand all of the examples, no matter how long. (I am a firm believer in repetition!)
- [ ] Take notes along the way
- [ ] Repeat on a new resource until there are greatly diminishing returns
- [ ] Keep at it until it sticks.

## Current Progress
- Currently working my way through Go Programming Language
